== Introduction
* Recap of our journey through different Azure deployment options for Java apps
* Introduction to Azure Functions as a serverless compute option
* The unique advantages of combining GraalVM native binaries with Azure Functions
* Challenges and considerations specific to Functions deployment
* What readers will learn in this blog post

== Understanding Azure Functions for Java
* How Azure Functions differs from AppService and Container Apps
* The serverless model and consumption-based pricing
* Trigger types available for Java functions
* Cold start considerations and why native binaries are particularly valuable
* Brief overview of the Azure Functions programming model

== Prerequisites
* Azure account and Azure CLI installed
* Azure Functions Core Tools
* Development environment with GraalVM setup
* Our Quarkus application from previous posts
* Understanding of function triggers and bindings

== Step 1: Adapting Your Application for Azure Functions
* Modifying our Quarkus application to work with the Functions model
* Converting REST endpoints to function triggers
* Implementing HTTP triggers for our load testing capabilities
* Setting up Quarkus Function extensions
* Configuration updates in application.properties

== Step 2: Native Compilation for Azure Functions
* Configuring Quarkus for Azure Functions native compilation
* Setting up the right GraalVM environment (addressing architecture issues)
* Using GitHub Codespaces for consistent compilation environment
* Function-specific considerations for native image generation
* Building the native binary with proper dependencies

== Step 3: Deploying the Native Binary to Azure Functions
* Creating a Function App in Azure
* Configuring the hosting plan (Consumption vs Premium)
* Setting up application settings and environment variables
* Deploying the native binary using Azure Functions Core Tools
* Verifying deployment success

== Step 4: Function-Specific Monitoring Setup
* Understanding the Azure Functions monitoring architecture
* Enabling Application Insights for your Function App
* Key metrics specific to Functions (execution count, execution units)
* Cold start monitoring for native functions
* Configuring sampling and telemetry settings

== Step 5: Analyzing Function Performance
* Execution time analysis for native vs JVM functions
* Memory consumption patterns in serverless environment
* Cold start comparison between native and traditional deployments
* Scaling behavior and concurrent execution metrics
* Cost implications of native binaries in Functions

== Step 6: Advanced Monitoring Techniques
* Using custom metrics to track business-specific KPIs
* Creating custom dimensions for deeper analysis
* Live metrics stream for real-time monitoring
* Dependency tracking for external services (Postgres, OpenAI)
* End-to-end transaction monitoring

== Step 7: Setting Up Alerts and Notifications
* Functions-specific alert configurations
* Thresholds for execution time and failure rates
* Cost alerts for unexpected scaling events
* Integration with notification systems
* Proactive monitoring strategies

== Performance Optimization
* Fine-tuning memory allocation for native functions
* Optimizing dependencies for smaller package size
* Reducing cold start impact with pre-warming strategies
* Configuring host.json for performance
* Durable Functions considerations for long-running processes

== Comparison with Previous Deployment Models
* Side-by-side comparison: Functions vs AppService vs Container Apps
* Scenarios where Functions excel for native binaries
* Cost analysis across deployment models
* Operational overhead comparison
* Monitoring capability differences

== Conclusion
* Best practices for native Java in Azure Functions
* When to choose Functions over other deployment options
* Summary of monitoring approaches across our series
* Future directions in serverless Java development
* Series wrap-up and key takeaways
