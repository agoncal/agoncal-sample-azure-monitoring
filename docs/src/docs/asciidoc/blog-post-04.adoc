== Introduction
* Recap of the series journey so far (AppService deployments with JAR and native binaries)
* Introduction to Azure Container Apps as an alternative deployment target
* Why Container Apps might be a better fit for native binaries (better diagnostics, containerized by design)
* The challenges we previously faced with native binaries on AppService (architecture mismatches, GLIBC issues)
* What readers will gain from this post

== Understanding Azure Container Apps
* What is Azure Container Apps and how it differs from AppService
* Key benefits: built-in Kubernetes-like orchestration without K8s complexity
* Scaling capabilities (including scale to zero)
* Traffic splitting and revision management
* Better native support for containerized workloads
* Built-in Dapr integration possibilities

== Prerequisites
* Azure account and Azure CLI installed
* Docker installed locally
* Development environment configured for native compilation
* GitHub Codespaces setup (to avoid architecture mismatch issues)
* Our Quarkus application from previous posts

== Step 1: Preparing Your Native Binary for Container Apps
* Review of the architecture considerations (AMD64 vs ARM64)
* Using the right base image for your Dockerfile
* Best practices for containerizing native binaries
* Setting up proper health checks for Container Apps
* Port configuration and environment variables

== Step 2: Building the Native Container Image
* Creating an optimized Dockerfile for native binaries
* Compiling in the right environment (GitHub Codespaces)
* Multi-stage builds for smaller images
* Using distroless containers for security and size benefits
* Pushing to Azure Container Registry

== Step 3: Setting Up Azure Container Apps Environment
* Creating a Container Apps environment
* Configuring networking and ingress
* Setting up secrets and configuration
* Resource allocation considerations for native binaries

== Step 4: Deploying the Native Container
* Deployment via Azure CLI
* Setting revision and scaling rules
* Configuring environment variables
* Verifying deployment success
* Troubleshooting strategies (with better log access than AppService)

== Step 5: Monitoring Setup for Container Apps
* Container Apps built-in monitoring capabilities
* Setting up Application Insights for deeper telemetry
* Configuring Log Analytics for the Container Apps environment
* Prometheus metrics integration options
* Exploring Container Apps logs and diagnostics features

== Step 6: Advanced Monitoring Scenarios
* Monitoring revisions during blue/green deployments
* Tracking scale events and cold starts
* Performance comparisons with AppService deployments
* Custom dashboards focused on container metrics
* Memory and CPU efficiency tracking across container revisions

== Step 7: Alerts and Notifications
* Setting up appropriate alerting thresholds for native containers
* Resource utilization alerts specific to Container Apps
* Availability and performance alerting
* Integration with notification systems

== Performance Analysis
* Startup time comparison: AppService vs Container Apps for native binaries
* Memory footprint analysis
* Request throughput and latency metrics
* Cold start behavior in Container Apps environment
* Cost implications of the Container Apps deployment model

== Conclusion
* When to choose Container Apps over AppService for native binaries
* Summary of monitoring capabilities unique to Container Apps
* Best practices learned throughout the deployment journey
* Final thoughts on the native Java experience in Azure
